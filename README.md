# Day four

## Coding Challenge:
There are two challenges today, expectation is that you solve atleast one of them using recursion and following a Test Driven Development approach. 


### Challenge two:
Power(a, b) is a function that calculates the mathematical ‘a’ raised to a power ‘b’. Using recursion provide  a python implementation of the power(a,b) function. 
For example:
```
power(3, 4)  # returns 81 which is (3 * 3 * 3 * 3)
power(2, 3) # returns 8 which is (2 * 2 * 2 )
```
